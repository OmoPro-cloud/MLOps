           ------ check https://localhost:8080 to see if live ------

#Check logs
docker logs nginx-test

#Stop and remove container

Questions:

1: What happened to data inside an ephemeral container when it stops?
- Any data you create inside the container disappears once it stops. Thereâ€™s no lasting record unless you set up persistence explicitly
2: What is the difference between an image and a container?
- An image is a static blueprint. A container is the active version of that blueprint, with a writable layer you can modify during runtime
3: Why do we need a registry?
A registry is a central hub where images are stored and shared. It makes it easy to reuse, distribute, and collaborate on images without rebuilding everything from scratch
