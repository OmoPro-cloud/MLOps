#Assignment â€“ Extended Dog Class
#Modify the Dog class to include the following:

#An additional attribute called breed. X

#A method called celebrate_birthday() that increases the dog's age by 1 and returns a message like:
#"Buddy is now 6 years old. Happy Birthday!" X

#Update the walk() method so it returns a message like:
#"Buddy is walking happily in the park." X

#Add a method rename(new_name) to change the dog's name.

#Create at least 3 dog objects with different names, ages, and breeds.
#Demonstrate usage of all methods in your program:

#Make each dog bark.

#Print their age and breed.

#Make one dog celebrate its birthday.

#Rename one dog.

#Make all dogs walk.

#Bonus Task (Optional):
#Create a method compare_age(other_dog) that compares two dogs' ages and returns a message stating which dog is older.


#Expected Skills Practiced:

#__init__ constructor

#Instance variables

#Writing multiple methods

#Passing objects as parameters (bonus)
