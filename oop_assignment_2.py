#Assignment â€“ Banking System (Encapsulation & Inheritance)
#Objective: Practice Encapsulation and Inheritance by modeling a small banking system.

#Instructions:

#Create a BankAccount class with:

#Private attributes: account number, account holder name, and balance.

#Getter methods to view account details.

#Methods to deposit and withdraw money (with validation).

#Create a SavingsAccount class that inherits from BankAccount:

#Add an attribute for interest rate.
#Add a method to calculate and apply interest.

#Create a CurrentAccount class that inherits from BankAccount:

#Add an overdraft limit.

#Modify withdrawal logic to allow overdraft within the limit.

#Write a main program to:

#Create one savings account and one current account.

#Perform deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations.

#Print updated account details.

#Expected Skills Practiced:

#Private attributes & methods (Encapsulation)

#Class inheritance

#Method overriding

      print('Sorry, your selected deposit amount has to be greater than $0!')
