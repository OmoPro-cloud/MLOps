#Assignment â€“ Shape Drawing Program (Polymorphism & Abstraction)
#Objective: Practice Polymorphism and Abstraction by designing a shape-drawing application.

#Instructions:

#Create an abstract class Shape with:

#An abstract method area()

#An abstract method perimeter()

#Create subclasses:

#Rectangle (with attributes: length, width)

#Circle (with attribute: radius)

#Triangle (with attributes: base, height, side lengths)

#Implement the abstract methods in each subclass.
#Write a function that takes a list of different shapes and prints:

#Shape type

#Area

#Perimeter

#Test it by creating a list with at least 5 shapes of different types.

#Expected Skills Practiced:

#Abstract classes and methods (Abstraction)

#Method overriding (Polymorphism)

#Unified handling of different objects through a common interface
